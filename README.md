##Motivation
The TinBot was made as a personal project for studing Arduino, the Firmata Protocol and the Universal Windows Apps. 

##Under the hood
- Some servos (for moving arms, head, body, etc)
- A huge supercapcitor (so the Lion battery can handle all servos at once)
- Leds, resistors, switches (the basic stuff)
- Lumia 520 with Windows 10 (for running a uwp app wich is the TinBot's brain)
- HC-06 bluetooth module (connecting the Arduino with the Lumia Phone)
- [Firmata](https://github.com/firmata/arduino)(the protocol used for remote controle the Arduino)
- [Windows Remote Arduino](https://github.com/ms-iot/remote-wiring)(the Microsoft implementation of Firmata for UWPs)
